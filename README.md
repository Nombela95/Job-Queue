# Job Queue Implementation

A TypeScript implementation of a configurable job queue with concurrency control, rate limiting, and timeout handling.

## Features

- Concurrency Control: Limit simultaneous job executions
- Rate Limiting: Control jobs started per minute
- Timeout Handling: Automatic job termination
- FIFO Processing: First-in-first-out execution order
- Detailed Metrics: Track queue time and execution time
- Graceful Shutdown: Dispose mechanism for clean termination
